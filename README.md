Innovator Sandbox is the place to Learn by Doing!
Lean Startup Nights is an idea togehter with Agility Lab to start a bi-weekly learning by doing meetup where the focus will be on Lean Startup and Agile Scrum methods.  The format of the night is ala "Lean Coffee" forum discussion led by a presenter or a panel. Themes will vary depending on duration of idea pitches.

Topics covered range from idea and product pitches, and hands-on like coding frameworks and Adobe Photoshop, or training workshops like “The Daily Scrum”.  The meeting is built upon an idea for an open source framework called LEARN X that uses Lean Startup and Scrum methods to improve communication and build better, ad-hoc and disperse teams.

In the spirit of Lean Startup and experimentation, this is our experiment for the Lean Startup Nights idea.


Lean Fight Club aka Lean Fail Club:  Is a club for hackers, designers, noobs, and wannabe's that want to compete for traction of a great idea.  Whether you have an idea or side project you want help with or you would like to learn a coding framework while helping someone else get great traction on their idea, then Lean Fight Club is for you.

The first rule of Lean Fight Club is that you don't talk about Lean Fight Club. Seriously though, we actually only talk about Lean Fight Club at Lean Fight Club for certain confidentiality reasons, but otherwise we generally encourage talking...especially to your target groups.

The second rule of Lean Fight Club is that you have to come to Lean Fight Club.  It is a year long competition and the winner is determined by the leaderboard.  The leaderboard is ranked by teams that gain the most traction on their project(s).

Proposed implementation and changes to the meetings framework is reviewed at each meeting and updated in the open source git hub project found at https://github.com/leanstartupnight/leanstartupnight 

Merges to the InnovatorSandbox framework are approved at the InnovatorSandbox Townhall Meeting. Find your local chapter and meetup or join the hangout that best suits your time.
