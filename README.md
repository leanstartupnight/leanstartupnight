# leanstartupnight
Documentation repository for the Lean Startup Night group to introduce the InnovatorSandbox.

The InnovatorSandbox is a place to learn and practice an open source framework for improving communication in teams.
The framework coined LEARNX is dynamic, customizable, and community driven while the implementation is practiced and refined in the annual InnovatorSandbox Challenge.

The InnovatorSandbox Challenge is a competition in the spirit of Startup Weekends and Hack-a-thons where teams will build and design lean startup experiments for various projects that are pitched by aspiring and seasoned entrepreneurs alike.

Merges to the InnovatorSandbox framework are approved at the InnovatorSandbox Townhall Meeting. Find your local chapter and meetup or join the hangout that best suits your time.
