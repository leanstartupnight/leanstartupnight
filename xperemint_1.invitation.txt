# leanstartupnight

(this is the invitation created for the first meetup group on September 29, 2015)

Hi! I’m Kevin, a startup entrepreneur that works with and is fanatic about Lean Startup and Scrum.  I have worked as a developer, manager, consultant, and currently have my own consultancy coaching and leading software development projects of all types and sizes and specialize in large ERP implementations. 

Lean Startup Experiments Night is an idea to introduce an open source framework to improve communication and build teams while learning lean startup experiments by doing them.

The implementation of the framework is based on Lean Startup, Scrum, and PRINCE 2 (and dashed with various other methods too). 

I would like to have your feedback regarding the framework and hear about general interest in starting it as an open source project. 

The meetup is targets all lean, agile, designer, coder, entrepreneur, and start up types that use processes in daily work and/or just want to learn more about how to implement various methodologies into daily processes to improve the communication of teams and help build stronger teams.

At the moment I’m looking for a sponsor for snacks and drinks so please get in touch if you could help out with that end of it.

Looking forward to hear from you all and see you at the meetup!
